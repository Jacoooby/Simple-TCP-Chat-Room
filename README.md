# Simple TCP Chat Room

This project is one of my first attempts at working with networking concepts.
It currently supports basic local TCP communication between a server and multiple clients (on the same device).

# How to Run 
1. Start the server.py
2. Open as many clients.py as you would like to have communicate with one another. To open multiple clients, right-click client.py and
   select "Open in Terminal" for each new instance.


# Features
- Local network chat over TCP
- Multiple client support

# Notes
- Only works on localhost (127.0.0.1)
- No encryption or authentication yet.
